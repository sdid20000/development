# Organization and Data

This section is dedicated to talking about the architecture and data flow of the website.

## Organization

App handles a lot of the data holding. The information from app is passed into filteredlist, which handles the filtering and sorting based on the corresponding parameters. That sorted information is then passed into DisplayList, which creates a map of MyCard. MyCard uses a bootstrap card and is set up this way just to make organization easier.

For the cart, the information is passed in from App, and cart creates a map of CartCard. A different card is used since the description and switch information are not needed for the cart.

## State Changes

State changes occur in App.js whenever items are added to the cart either by clicking the buttons inside of the cart or adding them through the "add to cart" button in each card. For the list of items, the state is changed whenever a user clicks on any of the sorting or filtering buttons.

## Data

Most of the data is stored in App.js. When an item is added to the cart, it calls the function inside of App.js with a reference to it's own data. This data is stored in an array, with two arrays also being used to store the name and corresponding quantity added to the cart. A similar function is passed into the cart, so then you could alter the quantity of items in the cart directly inside.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
